  <h2>Student Feedback</h2>

  <blockquote><q>One of my favorite professors at Duke. Brilliant, engaging, passionate about what he's teaching, accessible, fun.</q></blockquote>

  <blockquote> <q>One of the best teachers I've ever had. His understanding of SciFi but also knowledge outside the course material is impeccable. As an introduction to literature this teacher introduces how a literature guru thinks and draws information into the course.</q></blockquote>

  <blockquote>"Great professor who is very knowledgeable about the subject matter and about many intertwining subjects."</blockquote>
  <blockquote>"A really good course! Insightful discussion, good choice of literature, mind-bending (in a good way) theoretical readings."</blockquote>

      During the summer of 2017 at the National Humanities Center in North Carolina, I collaborated with other instructors and mentors to compose lessons informed by our doctoral research. My lesson, “Written Experimentations in Laboratories and Role-Playing Games,” translates the specialized discourses of science and technology studies and media theory into undergraduate course material.</li>
